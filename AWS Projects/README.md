# AWS Cloud Projects

This directory contains practical and hands-on projects built on Amazon Web Services (AWS), designed to demonstrate core cloud architecture patterns and services.

Each project showcases real-world scenarios using services such as EC2, VPC, Load Balancers, API Gateway, IAM, and more. Projects focus on both availability and security, and are implemented using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and/or the AWS Management Console.

## Project Levels

- **Beginner:** Foundational networking, compute, and IAM configurations
- **Intermediate:** High availability, secure access patterns, and service integrations

## Documentation

Project-specific architecture guides, CLI commands, and diagrams are included to help replicate each setup.

## Contribution & Schedule

New projects are added regularly to build practical cloud experience and strengthen infrastructure understanding.
